Solarized is a color palette created by Ethan Schoonover in 2011, which is
designed to reduce eye strain and enhance readability. It is a carefully
crafted set of colors that can be used for both light and dark backgrounds, and
is popular among developers and designers.

REQUIREMENTS üõ†Ô∏è                     *solarized.nvim-requirements-üõ†Ô∏è*

Before using Solarized Colorscheme, please ensure that you have the following
requirements installed:

- Treesitter <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter>


INSTALLATION                                     *solarized.nvim-installation*

To use the Solarized color scheme in your code editor or terminal, you can
install the Solarized colorscheme plugin using the Packer plugin manager.
Packer is a popular plugin manager for Neovim and Vim, and it allows you to
easily install and manage plugins for your editor.

To install the Solarized colorscheme plugin via Packer, you can follow the
steps below.

`~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua`

>lua
    use {
      'maxmx03/solarized.nvim',
      config = function ()
        local success, solarized = pcall(require, 'solarized')
    
        vim.o.background = 'dark'
    
        solarized:setup {
          config = {
            theme = 'neovim',
            transparent = false
          }
        }
    
        vim.cmd 'colorscheme solarized'
      end
    }
<


SWITCHING BETWEEN DARK AND LIGHT MODE*solarized.nvim-switching-between-dark-and-light-mode*

By default, the Solarized color scheme is set to use the dark mode variant.
However, if you prefer a lighter background, you can easily switch to the light
mode variant. To switch to the light mode variant, you can add the following
line to your Neovim or Vim configuration file:

`vim.o.background = 'light'`

This will set the background color to a light gray color, allowing you to use
the Solarized light mode color palette. If you prefer the dark mode variant,
you can set the background color to a darker color by adding the following line
to your configuration file instead:

`vim.o.background = 'dark'`


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS                   *solarized.nvim-configuration-options*

The Solarized color scheme provides several configuration options that you can
use to customize the look and feel of the colors. Here is a list of the
available options and their default values:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Option        Default        Description
  ------------- -------------- ----------------------------------------------
  theme         'vim'          The theme comes in three styles: vim, neovim,
                               vscode

  transparent   false          Enable and disable background transparency

  colors        {} or function You can add new colors or override the
                               defaults

  highlights    {} or function You can add new highlights or override the
                               defaults
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THEME                                                   *solarized.nvim-theme*

The theme option allows you to choose between the three available theme styles:
vim, neovim, and vscode. The vim theme uses a slightly different color palette
than the neovim and vscode themes. By default, the vim theme is used. To change
the theme, add the following line to your Neovim or Vim configuration file:

>lua
    solarized:setup {
     config = {
      theme = 'neovim' -- or 'neovim' or 'vscode'
     }
    }
<


TRANSPARENT                                       *solarized.nvim-transparent*

The transparent option allows you to enable or disable background transparency.
By default, transparency is disabled. To enable transparency, add the following
line to your Neovim or Vim configuration file:

>lua
    solarized:setup {
     config = {
      transparent = true
     }
    }
<


COLORS                                                 *solarized.nvim-colors*

The colors option allows you to add new colors or override the default color
palette. This option accepts a table or a function that returns a table. The
table should contain color definitions using hexadecimal RGB values. By
default, this option is set to an empty table. Here is an example of how to set
the colors option to a table:

>lua
    require("solarized"):setup({
      colors = {
        bg      = "#282a36",
        bg_alt  = "#44475a",
        comment = "#6272a4",
        fg      = "#f8f8f2",
        content = "#f8f8f2",
        yellow  = "#f1fa8c",
        orange  = "#ffb86c",
        red     = "#ff5555",
        magenta = "#ff79c6",
        violet  = "#bd93f9",
        blue    = "#6272a4",
        cyan    = "#8be9fd",
        green   = "#50fa7b",
    
      }
    })
<

In this example, we‚Äôre using the Dracula color scheme by setting the colors
table to a list of color values that match the Dracula color palette. You can
replace these values with your own custom colors if you prefer.


HIGHLIGHTS                                         *solarized.nvim-highlights*

The highlights option allows you to add new highlight groups or override the
default highlight groups. This option accepts a table or a function that
returns a table. The table should contain highlight group definitions that use
the color names defined in the colors table. By default, this option is set to
an empty table. Here is an example of how to set the highlights option to a
table:

>lua
    solarized:setup {
      colors = {
        bg      = "#282a36",
        bg_alt  = "#44475a",
        comment = "#6272a4",
        fg      = "#f8f8f2",
        content = "#f8f8f2",
        yellow  = "#f1fa8c",
        orange  = "#ffb86c",
        red     = "#ff5555",
        magenta = "#ff79c6",
        violet  = "#bd93f9",
        blue    = "#6272a4",
        cyan    = "#8be9fd",
        green   = "#50fa7b",
      },
      highlights = function(colors, darken, lighten, blend)
        return {
          Normal       = { fg = colors.fg, bg = colors.bg },
          Comment      = { fg = colors.comment, bg = darken(colors.bg, 10), italic = true },
          Constant     = { fg = colors.cyan },
          Identifier   = { fg = colors.green },
          Statement    = { fg = colors.yellow },
          PreProc      = { fg = colors.orange },
          Type         = { fg = colors.red },
          Special      = { fg = colors.magenta },
          Visual       = { bg = blend(colors.magenta, colors.bg, 1.25) },
        }
      end
    }
<

Here‚Äôs a brief explanation of the `darken`, `lighten`, and `blend` functions
that you can use in your Lua code:

- `darken(color, amount)`: Returns a darker version of the input `color` by
    reducing the value (i.e., brightness) component of the color by `amount` (a
    value between 1 and 100). For example, `darken('#FF0000', 20)` would return a
    darker shade of red.
- `lighten(color, amount)`: Returns a lighter version of the input `color` by
    increasing the value (i.e., brightness) component of the color by `amount` (a
    value between 1 and 100). For example, `lighten('#FF0000', 20)` would return a
    lighter shade of red.
- `blend(color, blend_color, amount)`: Returns a blended version of the input
    `color` and `blend_color`, where `amount` specifies the strength of the blend
    (a value between 0 and 1). A value of 0 would result in the original `color`,
    and a value of 1 would result in `blend_color`. For example, `blend('#FF0000',
    '#00FF00', 0.5)` would result in a blend of red and green, which is yellow.

These functions can be useful for generating variations of a given color, or
for creating more complex color schemes by blending multiple colors together.
The `blend` function in particular can be used to simulate a "glow" effect by
blending a color with a brighter version of itself.
